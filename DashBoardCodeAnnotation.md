Analysis of the Dashboard:

Whilst creating this script i did not use any tools this was because I thought publishing this code in github would be a
good idea as it can include other partners in my group. Github also allows me to track changes to the code. It makes a good
base to work off. 

I used a basic approach of coding into this because if there was errors i could easily locate them whilst making a fix to
them. I was going to use Variables for the gaps of names but wanted to keep it the way it was planned in the wireframes
to stop confusion. I thought making the spaces inbetween each line of code makes a lot more readable. I tried my best to
make this script as user friendly as possible for new users to read.
